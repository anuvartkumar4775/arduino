/*
 This is the example of serial data reception
 in this case laptop is senmding the dataserially to arduino board via usb port
 arduino will recieve the data serially and we will use the serial data byte
 recieved for controlling the onboard LED`
 If a is recieved serially then LED will be turned ON, Acknoledgement will be sent back "LED is ON"
 If B is recieved serially then LED will be turned OFF, Acknowledgement will be sent back "LED is OFF" 
 */
char temp; // variable to recieve serial data byte
int myLed = 13; //my Led refers to pin no. 13 of Arduino
 
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600); // initialize serial communication at 9600bps baud rate
  pinMode(myLed,OUTPUT); // configure pin 13 as output pin
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  while(!Serial.available()); // stay here in case no serial data is recieved
  if(Serial.available()>0)
  {
    temp = Serial.read(); // read the data byte recieved and store in variable temp
    if(temp=='A')
    {
     //turn ON the LED
     digitalWrite(myLed,HIGH);
     Serial.println("LED is ON");
    }
    if(temp=='8')
    {
      //turn OFF the LED
      digitalWrite(myLed,LOW);
